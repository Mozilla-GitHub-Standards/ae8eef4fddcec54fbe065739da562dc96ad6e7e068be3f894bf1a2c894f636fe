Electron and essentials to get you started writing cross platform desktop apps in no time based on [Electron](https://electronjs.org/), [React](https://reactjs.org/), [React Router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router), [Styled Components](https://www.styled-components.com/), [Material UI](https://material-ui.com), [Jest](https://jestjs.io) and [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/).
It offers a carefully selected range of packages and configurations to setup a featured development environment and a production ready build.

## Reasons

At the time of diving into Electron and using React as UI library for a new project I was unable to find a boilerplate which implemented Electron and Jest or tests in general. There was only a handful of boilerplates which were actually suitable to built on for production ready apps. Most noteable the boilerplates from `chentsulin`, `electron-forge` and extending - by forking or re-wireing - `react-scripts` from Facebook's `create-react-app`. Long story short, at the end my needs and wishes outweighted the work put into extending `react-scripts` and possibly maintaing the fork in the future that I decided to not get bald and to write my own custom boilerplate based on my wishes and the trends I observed in the community.

## Usage

The project recommends `yarn`. If you have not installed `yarn` follow the individual platform instructions [here](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install). For MacOS it is as easy as running `brew install yarn`.

```
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/mozillasecurity/electron-genesis <project-name>
cd <project-name>
yarn install
```

You have now successfully checked-out the base for your new project. To run the development version use `yarn start` and to produce a production build run `yarn dist`.

## Commands

For a detailed list of commands take a look into the `scripts` section of `package.json`.

### Development

```
yarn start

yarn test
yarn typecheck
yarn lint
yarn format
yarn docs

yarn updates
```

### Production

```
yarn dist
```

Dev-Dependency: ðŸ”§

## ESLint, Flow and Prettier Integration

### Linting

- ESLint will check JS/JSX for correctness.
- Styleint and the attached processor extract the CSS out of Styled-Components to check it for correctness.

### Type Checking

- Flow will check JS/JSX code for type-safety.

### Formatting

- Prettier is an opinionated formatter and will format the style for multiple filetypes automatically.

## VSCode Integration

This package comes with a `.vscode/settings.json` workspace configuration file and set recommended values.

### Recommended VSCode Extensions

Recommended to get the most out of this package. The configurations already exist in this package if you choose to use VSCode for development.

## ðŸ™ˆ Issues

- #### Babel 7

  As soon as Parcel adds support for Babel 7, the Babel dependencies can be upgraded to use scopes. See also the [Babel 7 migration guide](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/v7-migration) for other changes required and the Parcel WIP [issue](https://github.com/parcel-bundler/parcel/issues/868)

  ```
  "@babel/cli": "^7.0.0",
  "@babel/core": "^7.0.0",
  "@babel/preset-env": "^7.0.0",
  "@babel/preset-flow": "^7.0.0",
  "@babel/preset-react": "^7.0.0",
  "@babel/preset-stage-2": "^7.0.0",
  ```

- #### Flow LSP

  Running flow through the `Language Server Protocol` is still experimental.

  ```
  "flow.useLSP": true
  ```

- #### vscode-jest & jest-runner/electron

  Does not always play nicely together for unknown reasons which it is a known issue.

  ```
  node_modules/@jest-runner/electron/build/electron_process_injected_code.js:25
  _electron.app.on('ready', async () => {
              ^
  TypeError: Cannot read property 'on' of undefined
  ```

- #### prettier-stylint and styled-components

  It was unsuccessful to get `prettier-stylint` to format and to `--fix` CSS inside `styled-comonents`.
  Prettier has built-in support now for `styled-components` but does not do any linting.
